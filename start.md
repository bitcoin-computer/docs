If you are trying out the Bitcoin Computer for the first time we recommend to follow the readme file of the Bitcoin Computer Library. If you want to integrate into a new or existing application you will also need the Bitcoin Computer Library.

You can run a Bitcoin Computer Node through docker. You need to run a node if you want to run an application on mainnet. It also offers a great development experience.
