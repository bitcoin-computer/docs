# Start

## Quick Start

To try out the Bitcoin Computer please follow the instructions on NPM.

[!ref target="blank" text="Bitcoin Computer Library"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bitcoin-computer/lib)

You will be connected to a Bitcoin Computer Node on testnet that we run so you don't have to deal with setting it up.

## Run a Node

If you want to run an application on mainnet or regtest (recommended for serious development) you can run your own node.

## Build an Application

The easiest way to get started is to clone our monorepo and start from one of the example applications (look for the package called Wallet for example).
