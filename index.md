# Bitcoin Computer

**Lightweight smart contracts for Litecoin**

You can build trustless, non-custodial web applications that are as secure and available as Litecoin. Applications can be games, social networks, NFTs, fungible tokens, stable coins, exchanges, auctions, voting, decentralized key-value stores, office applications, artificial intelligence, every application you can think of.

## Simple

Smart contracts are Javascript classes that inherit from a special class called ``Contract``. Instances of smart contracts, called smart objects, are stored on the Litecoin blockchain. A smart object has one or more owners and only owners can update the smart object by calling one of its functions. Each smart object also has an unique identifier and anyone can read the latest state of the smart object if they know its identifier. This makes it easy to build applications in which multiple parties collaborate on shared state.

## Efficient

On most smart contract systems fees are charged for every computational step and for every memory allocation or update. Bitcoin has always had smart contracts with free computation called colored coins. This is because smart contracts are evaluated by users client-side instead of by miners. Bitcoin Computer smart contracts lightweight as they do not impose any additional work on miners, node operators, or other users.

The only fee that needs to be paid is the mining fee plus a Bitcoin Computer fee that is equal to the mining fee. The fixed fee makes it possible, for the first time, to run compute and memory intense programs as smart contracts.

## Trustless

You can run your own [node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bitcoin-computer/node) and direct our client side [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bitcoin-computer/lib) to it. The node gives you trustless access to the Bitcoin Computer. Nobody can revoke your access if you have a copy of the node and the lib. You can think of a node as a universal backend that can power any application.

We are launching at the [Litecoin Summit](https://www.litecoin.net/summit) on October 21st :rocket:
