# Bitcoin Computer

Lightweight smart contracts on Bitcoin and Litecoin

## Simple

The Bitcoin Computer makes it possible to run smart contracts on UTXO based blockchains like Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Dogecoin. You can write smart contracts in Javascript and store instances of the smart contracts (called smart objects) on a UTXO based blockchain. Each smart object has one or more owners. Owners can update the smart object but nobody else. Each smart object also has an unique identifier and anyone can read the latest state of the smart object if they know the identifier.

You can build  games, social networks, NFTs, fungible tokens, stable coins, exchanges, auctions, voting, decentralized key-value stores, office applications, artificial intelligence, every application you can think of. Building applications is simple because our smart contracts written in Javascript integrate seamlessly into web applications.

## Efficient

On most smart contract systems fees are charged for every computational step and for every memory allocation or update. Bitcoin has always had smart contracts with free computation called colored coins. This is because smart contracts are evaluated by users client-side instead of by miners. Bitcoin Computer smart contracts lightweight as they do not impose any additional work on miners, node operators, or other users.

The only fee that needs to be paid is the mining fee plus a Bitcoin Computer fee that is equal to the mining fee. The fixed fee makes it possible, for the first time, to run compute and memory intense programs as smart contracts.

## Trustless

You can run your own [node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bitcoin-computer/node) and direct our client side [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bitcoin-computer/lib) to it. The node gives you trustless access to the Bitcoin Computer. Nobody can revoke your access if you have a copy of the node and the lib. You can think of a node as a universal backend that can power any application.

We are launching at the [Litecoin Summit](https://www.litecoin.net/summit) on October 21st :rocket:
