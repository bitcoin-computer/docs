# Troubleshooting

## Wallet is currently rescanning. Abort existing rescan or wait.

When you use a seed phrase for the first time, the Bitcoin node needs to re-scan the blockchain. This usually takes around 10m but can take up to an hour. Just wait and try again.

## Insufficient balance in address

You need to fund the wallet inside the computer object.

The Bitcoin Computer currently supports Litecoin testnet. You can get free testnet coins from a Litecoin Testnet Faucet [here](https://testnet-faucet.com/ltc-testnet/), [here](https://testnet.help/en/ltcfaucet/testnet), [here](http://litecointf.salmen.website/), or [here](https://tltc.bitaps.com/).
We recommend generating a new seed phrase through a BIP39 generator.
